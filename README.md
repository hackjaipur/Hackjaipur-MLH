### About HackJaipur

HackJaipur is a community-focused virtual Hackathon, designed especially for the needs of the communities, with problem statements centered around the community itself. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, here is the perfect chance to hone and show your skills and witness the competitive yet inclusive developer community around you!  

In light of the CoronaVirus outbreak, your safety and well-being are our primary concerns. Hence, all the activities related to HackJaipur like workshops, talks, and presentations will also be conducted online/virtually. 

### Why Hack *Jaipur*?
_Jaipur has been always the mother of traditional communities even before the civilizations started_.

HackJaipur follows the same culture and seeks for different solutions to various issues the tradition face from time to time. HackJaipur represents the cultural integrity and bond of our tradition. 

We didn't start HackJaipur to simply conduct a Hackathon but to make people aware of our community's issues and solutions that exist currently.

### Tracks

Instead of having different challenges, at HackJaipur we've decided to have separate tracks. Your project doesn't have to fit perfectly into one track, it could be a mix and match of several (or all of them). We've chosen these tracks based on areas where we think that tech could be used to help solve some of the problems that the communities are currently facing.
1. Guiding a Visitor.
2. Communication tools.
3. Improving awareness and behaviour.
